## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Workflow Overview)

The workflow is structured into several key stages, ensuring a holistic approach to SEO analysis and optimization:

    *   **Related Searches & FAQs:** Scrapes "Related Searches" and extracts/generates "People Also Ask" (PAA) questions to identify long-tail keywords and content opportunities.
    *   **Analyze Competitors:** Crawls top SERP competitors, extracting headings, keyword usage, and metadata for benchmarking.
    *   **Purpose:** Understands current ranking landscape and establishes benchmarks.

3.  **URL Inspection & Page Speed Check:**
    *   **Fetch PageSpeed:** Utilizes Google PageSpeed Insights to assess load times, mobile/desktop performance, and Core Web Vitals.
    *   **Parse & Save Data:** Extracts key performance metrics (FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT) and stores them alongside SERP insights.
    *   **Purpose:** Diagnoses page experience issues and benchmarks technical performance.

4.  **Performance Analysis:**
    *   **Fetch & Save Data:** Queries historical performance metrics (optional GSC integration) and updates a database/Google Sheet.
    *   **Parse Data:** Prepares clean performance data for the optimization module.
    *   **Purpose:** Determines how technical performance impacts SEO ranking.

5.  **Crawl Article to be Optimized:**
    *   **Crawl & Parse:** Visits the target URL, downloads HTML/text content, and extracts title, meta description, headings (H1-H6), word count, and keyword frequency.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive view of the page's current content structure and SEO readiness.

6.  **(Optional) Translation:**
    *   **Translate Content:** Applies language translation (e.g., DeepL or GPT) for multi-language SEO or competitor content insights.
    *   **Purpose:** Facilitates multilingual analysis and content generation.

7.  **Data Analysis Using AI (GPT Nodes):**
    *   **Generate Insights:** Multiple GPT nodes generate SEO audit summaries, compare pages against competitors, and score readability, keyword optimization, and structure.
    *   **Common Prompts:** Includes prompts like "How does this page compare to competitors?", "Summarize SEO weaknesses," and "Suggest title/meta improvements."
    *   **Purpose:** Automates expert-level SEO audits without manual interpretation.

    *   **Format:** Formats the final document (Markdown, HTML, Google Docs/Sheets).
    *   **Purpose:** Prepares client-facing or internal reports for implementation.

10. **Store Report in Google Drive:**
    *   **Upload:** Pushes the final report to a specified Google Drive folder, optionally named by domain/keyword/date.
